# JavaChatApp
A chat application made in Java (has a GUI and all)

To start it, modify the IP and PORT in GuiClient and Server (or something like this, I don't even know what you're supposed to do anymore...)
then run in order:

Server.Java, TextClient.Java, GuiClient.Java

Open TextClient and GuiClient again for additional clients

This was a project for my object-oriented programming lab, year 2, faculty ETTI, there's not much else to say

Don't expect commented code, since I don't care that much about this
